Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
```
    var min = function(list){
        let minimum = list[0];
        for (var i = 1; i < list.length; i++){
            if (minimum > list[i])
                minimum = list[i]
        }
        return minimum;
    }
